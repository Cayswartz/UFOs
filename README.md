# UFO Sightings with JS

## Overview of Analysis
In this assignment, we built a webpage around UFOs sighting that would allow people to quickly and easily view UFOs sighting by state, city, shape and more! 


## Results
In order to conduct your search you will want to visit the website. On the website, along the left side, you will see a handful of different filter options available. Once you have typed in the filter that you are looking for you will see the table on the right change to match the item that you typed in.

## Summary
### Drawbacks
One of the drawbacks of this page is that you are unable to select multiple components for each filter. For example, if you wanted to see sighting in California and Arizona.

### Further Development
1. I would suggest creating a dropdown menu to allow users to see what options were available and to ensure they are properly typing in the different components
2. I would add a feature that would allow for more than one filter to be applied for each section.
